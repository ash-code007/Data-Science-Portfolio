      <description>Business Understanding and Problem Description: A US-based housing company has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
Our Job: We are required to build a regression model using advanced techniques like Iterative Imputation and Transformation for data wrangling; and Ridge/Lasso/ElasticNet Regularisation for modelling in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.</description>
