      <description>A Project completed as part of Deep Learning Nanodegree by Udacity.
  Built a Deep Learning Pipeline to process the real world ,user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
  The CNN model which was built from scratch achieved a Test Accuracy of 16% with a Limited and imbalanced dataset (With this data, it is even difficult for humans to correctly identify the breed of the dog).</description>
